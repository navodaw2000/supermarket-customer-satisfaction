# Research Questions & KPIs

## Primary Research Questions
1. What is the overall customer satisfaction level across supermarkets in Sri Lanka? (1-5)
2. Which supermarket chains score highest and lowest on overall satisfaction?
3. What are the main drivers of customer satisfaction (e.g., price, product availability, staff behavior, cleanliness)?
4. How does Net Promoter Score (NPS) vary between supermarkets and customer segments?
5. What actionable recommendations can reduce customer complaints and improve satisfaction?

## Secondary Research Questions
1. How does satisfaction vary by demographic groups (age, gender)?
2. Does shopping frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) affect satisfaction?
3. How does payment method (cash/card/mobile) relate to satisfaction?
4. Which store sections (produce, dairy, frozen, checkout) have the highest/lowest CSAT?
5. Is there a relationship between spend amount and satisfaction?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compute
- **Overall Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**: average of overall satisfaction (1-5 Likert).
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: %Promoters(9–10) − %Detractors(0–6).
- **Average Wait Time**: self-reported checkout waiting time (converted to numeric or categorical).
- **% Repeat Shoppers**: percent of respondents who shop regularly at the same supermarket.
- **CSAT by Store Section**: average satisfaction per section (produce, dairy, bakery, frozen, checkout).
- **Complaint Rate**: % respondents who reported a complaint during the visit.
- **Product Availability Rate**: % respondents who found everything they needed.
- **Average Basket Value (optional)**: average spend category converted to approximate value.

## Notes
- Use 95% confidence and record sample size per supermarket. 
- Anonymize any personally identifiable information before publishing data.
